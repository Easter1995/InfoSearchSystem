A story about a girl named Amélie whose childhood was suppressed by her father's mistaken concerns of a heart defect. With these concerns Amélie gets hardly any real-life contact with other people. This leads her to resort to her own fantastical world and dreams of love and beauty. She later on becomes a young woman and moves to the central part of Paris as a waitress. After finding a lost treasure belonging to the former occupant of her apartment, she decides to return it to him. After seeing his reaction and his newfound perspective, she decides to devote her life to the people around her: her father, who's obsessed with his garden gnome; a failed writer; a hypochondriac; a man who stalks his ex-girlfriends; the "ghost, a suppressed young soul; a man whose bones are as brittle as glass--and the love of her life. But after consuming herself with these escapades, she finds out that she is disregarding her own life and damaging her quest for love. Amélie then discovers that she must become more aggressive and take a hold of her life and capture the beauty of love of which she has always dreamed.
