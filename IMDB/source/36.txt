A simple and soft spoken barber in a small town reports the theft of Lakshmi ( his dustbin) to the police. Initially they are angry and amused and take it lightly but when he keeps insisting they start an investigation which throws up a number of suspects. Things however are not what they seem and the probe gets more and more complicated over time.
