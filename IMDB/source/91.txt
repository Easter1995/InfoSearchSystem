When Jesper distinguishes himself as the postal academy's worst student, he is stationed on a frozen island above the Arctic Circle where the feuding locals hardly exchange words let alone letters. Jesper is about to give up when he finds an ally in local teacher Alva and discovers Klaus, a mysterious carpenter who lives alone in a cabin full of handmade toys. These unlikely friendships return laughter to Smeerensburg, forging a new legacy of generous neighbors, magical lore, and stockings hung by the chimney with care.
