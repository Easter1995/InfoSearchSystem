Giovanna is taken to the Inquisition court and continues to pray in ecstasy after she's accused of blasphemy. A friar thinks that she's a saint but the solders take him away. Giovanna sees a cross in the shadow and feels comforted. She is not considered a daughter of God but a daughter of the devil and is sentenced to torture. Giovanna D 'Arco says that even if she dies she will not deny anything. The eyes are twisted by terror in front of the torture wheel and she faints and is taken to a bed, where she bleeds. When she feels that she is about to die, she asks to be buried in a consecrated area. While devoted ladies cry, Giovanna burns at the stake.
