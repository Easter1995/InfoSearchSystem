Antonio Ricci, an unemployed man in the depressed post-WWII economy of Italy, finally gets a job hanging up posters, but he needs a bicycle. When his bicycle is stolen, he and son walk the streets of Rome looking for it. Antonio finally manages to locate the thief, yet, with no proof he must abandon his cause. But he and his son know perfectly well that, without a bike, Antonio won't be able to keep his job.
