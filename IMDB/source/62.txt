The true story of Desmond T. Doss, the conscientious objector who, after the Battle of Okinawa, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his incredible bravery and regard for his fellow soldiers. Following his upbringing and how this shaped his views (especially his religious view and anti-killing stance), Doss's trials and tribulations after enlisting in the US Army (trying to become a medic) begin, preluding the hell on Earth that was Hacksaw Ridge.
