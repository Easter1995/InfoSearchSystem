A group of young men in their twenties make up the "Chaos class" at a boarding school. They have failed class yet again, and as they return for a new school year, they get a new literature teacher, a young woman who is straight out of university and in her first teaching job. They terrorize her, and the rest of the school, with childish pranks, and are thrown out of school in the end - unless it can all be forgiven.
