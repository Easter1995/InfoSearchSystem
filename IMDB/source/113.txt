rate: 8.2
Joseph L. Mankiewicz
Joseph L. Mankiewicz/Mary Orr
Bette Davis/Anne Baxter/George Sanders
Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is waiting backstage to meet her idol, talented but aging Broadway star Margo Channing (Bette Davis). It seems innocent enough as Eve explains that she has seen Margo in EVERY performance of her current play. Margo and her friends take Eve under their wing but only theatre critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) sees through Eve's evil plan, which is to take Margo's parts and her fianc√©, Bill Simpson (Gary Merrill) too.
